// test these particular things: the test runner cannot load TypeScript, and every rule below is a
// rule about what the RENDERED page contains rather than about a function's return value. The
// alternative - a browser harness in CI - would cover more and does not exist, and until it does an
// assertion that fails when somebody abbreviates an action list is worth more than none.

// was taught to accept the assessment digest on a plain approval while the page still had it nested
// under the restriction conditional, so the fence was never dispatched and nothing said why. Every
